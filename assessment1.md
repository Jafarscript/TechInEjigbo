## **🌟 Step 1: Create the Basic Structure of an HTML Page**  
Every webpage must start with a **basic structure**.  
👉 **Tip:** Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and use `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.  

**Write this in your file:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
✔ **Save and open in your browser**—you should see a heading!

---

## **🌟 Step 2: Add a Paragraph**  
Now, let's add some text to describe your page.  
👉 **Tip:** Use the `<p>` tag for paragraphs.  

**Write this inside the `<body>` tag:**  
```html
<p>Hello! My name is [Your Name], and this is my first webpage. I am learning HTML and it's really fun!</p>
```
✔ **Save and refresh** your browser—you should see your text!

---

## **🌟 Step 3: Add a List**  
Let's create a list of things you love!  
👉 **Tip:** Use `<ul>` for an **unordered list** (bullets) or `<ol>` for an **ordered list** (numbers).  
- `<li>` is used for each item in the list.  

**Write this inside the `<body>` tag:**  
```html
<h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reading books</li>
    <li>Playing games</li>
    <li>Drawing</li>
</ul>
```
✔ **Check your browser**—you should see a list of hobbies!

## **🌟 Step 4: Add an Image**  
Now, let's add a picture to make our webpage more interesting!  
👉 **Tip:** Use `<img>` and set the `src` attribute to the image location.  
👉 **Bonus Tip:** Use `alt` to describe the image in case it doesn't load.  

**Write this inside the `<body>` tag:**  
```html
<h2>Here is a Beautiful Flower</h2>
<img src="flower.jpg" alt="A beautiful pink flower" width="300">
```
✔ **Save and refresh** your browser.  
📌 **Make sure the image (flower.jpg) is in the same folder as your HTML file!**  
💡 If you don’t have an image, you can use an online one:  
```html
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" alt="A beautiful girl">
```

## **🌟 Step 5: Add a Link**  
Let's add a link so visitors can click and visit another page.  
👉 **Tip:** Use the `<a>` tag and set the `href` attribute to the website you want to link to.  

**Write this inside the `<body>` tag:**  
```html
<h2>Visit My Favorite Website</h2>
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Click here to visit Google</a>
```
✔ **Click the link in your browser**—it should open Google in a new tab!

---

## **🎯 Final Task: Put Everything Together**  
Your **final HTML file** should look like this:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is [Your Name], and this is my first webpage. I am learning HTML and it's really fun!</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading books</li>
        <li>Playing games</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Here is a Beautiful Flower</h2>
    <img src="flower.jpg" alt="A beautiful pink flower" width="300">

    <h2>Visit My Favorite Website</h2>
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Click here to visit Google</a>
</body>
</html>
```
